Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
This project demonstrates how to visualize data using popular Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. The code includes various examples of common visualizations like line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, and pie charts. It also explores more advanced plots using Seaborn, such as swarm plots and box plots, which are built on top of Matplotlib and offer enhanced functionality for Pandas data structures. 

Visualizations Covered:
Line Plot: Visualization of population growth over time using a basic line plot.
Scatter Plot: Representation of population growth with points, scaled by population size.
Bar Chart: Comparative example with two different bar charts.
Histogram: Visualization of city populations to understand data distribution.
Pie Chart: Percentage distribution of city populations.
Horizontal Bar Chart: Example of comparing studies based on daily distance traveled.
Swarm Plot (Seaborn): Displaying smartphone battery capacity grouped by operating system.
Box Plot (Seaborn): Analysis of RAM distribution by smartphone company.
Libraries Used:
NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
Seaborn: For making statistical visualizations with built-in support for Pandas data frames.
Pandas: For handling structured data (in this case, the smartphones.csv dataset).
Example Data:
Population Data: Used to create line, scatter, bar, histogram, and pie charts.
Smartphone Dataset: Contains smartphone specifications used for creating Seaborn plots.
